				You have created a stir in my heart, <br>
				This I know, by the change I have experienced, <br>
				Oh! How lovely your company feels 	<br>
				Diving deep into the other world amidst pure ambience.
		</p>

		<p>
				Before, my heart felt empty, dark and lonely, <br>
				Then you came holding your light, bright and shiny, <br>
				You asked, whether you should stay, <br>
				I instantly replied, in you my foundations lay.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since then, it feels ages, time is of no relevance, <br>
			Your promises are my inspiration, ever present, <br>
			Waiting for the promised land has never been so easy <br>
			For your grace comforts me effortlessly.

				<p>A child comes to call me for the feast, <br>
				   to a table full of mince, amidst gathering full of beings. <br>
				   I try to look for a kind smile, <br>
				   But all I find is treachery <br>
				   hidden in a veil of snary lies.
				</p>

				<p>Hearts of stone need His presence <br>
				   For this is the way that He recommends <br>
				   Deep inside, those beings have His hidden light <br>
				   which has been further stifled by authoritarian heights. 
				</p>

				<p>Honey gets created when the beings are submissive,  <br>
				   Holiness as well as holistic view then overshadows their deep inner spaces. <br>
				   It is better this way to hope for a better world, <br>
				   For we all are work in progress supported by His merciful graces.
