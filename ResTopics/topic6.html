		<p><strong>Inmate Ring</strong></p> 

		<p>Prisoners or inmates are locked up for several years to keep society safe from them. The question comes, when does a person commit crime? According to the judicial system, a person commits crime when he/she consciously hurts a human physically or in some cases mentally that the other person suffers ot commits suicide.</p> 

		<p>Now, what type of people does the society want? Or more precisely, who are allowed to live in the human/civilized society ?</p>

		<p>The answer would be mentally stable humans who are non agressive in nature.</p> 

		<p>Now, there are many conditions laid by the law/judicial system as to how many years a person should spent time in prison. The tenure may range from 3 years to 15 years to greater than 80 years.</p>

		<p>Now, let us consider a person who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. After 10 years, that person is set free and is allowed by law to again get back to human society and live and lead his/her normal life. Now, if that person was sentenced to 10 years in prison, then that person must have been pretty aggresive(physically) in the eyes of the law.</p>

		<p>Now, do you think that after 10 years, the tendency/habit of aggressiveness has been totally cured from the person's physiological precess?</p>

		<p>Moreover, does 10 years of prison life change an inamtes brain/habits physically as to make him more stable and liveable in human society? Even if it does, 10 years is a long time, <strong>the inmate at his very core is a living, breathing human just like any other human being in the society.
		</strong></p>

		<p>He/She deserves to enjoy this graceful life with freedom and with an open heart, rather than with regrets and bitterness of heart.</p>

		<p>Thus <strong>Inmate Ring</strong> can act as a futuristic device/technology to alter the aggresive aspect of an inmate by changing the ill physiological processes along with faulty brain patterns and mechanism to bring him back to society as soon as possible within months of his initial prison time.</p>

		<p>Though, by dong so, there may arise some loopholes in the system of crimes and its management, for that the dicussions will be continued in the course of this research.</p>
