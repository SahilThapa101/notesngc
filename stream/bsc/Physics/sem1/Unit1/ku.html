		<p><strong>Q1)</strong> Define elasticity. Derive the interrelationship between elastic moduli.</p>

		<p id="new">=> Elasticity is the property by virtue of which a body undergoing a change in its configuration due to application of some external forces tends to regain its original configuration on the removal of deforming force.

				<br><br>

				Elastic moduli are- Young's modulus(Y), Bulk modulus(k) and Rigidity modulus(&#951;).

			<strong><u>Relationship between Y, k and &#963;:</u></strong>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspY = 3k(1-2&#963;) -------(i)  &nbsp&nbspwhere &#963; = Poisson's ratio <br><br>
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspY = 2&#951;(1+&#963;)  -------(ii)

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

				 1-2&#963; = Y/3k <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

				 2+2&#963; = Y/&#951; <br> &nbsp&nbsp
				---------------------  <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
					3 = Y/3k + Y/&#951;

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspY(&#951;+3k) = 9k&#951; <br><br>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(&#951;+3k)/k&#951; = 9/Y <br><br>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1/k + 3/&#951; = 9/Y.

		 	<strong><u>Critical velocity:</u> </strong> &nbsp<p id="new">The limiting velocity of flow at the streamline motion just becomes impossible is called the critical velocity.</p>

		 	<strong><u>Angle of Contact:</u></strong> <p id="new">The angle of contact, for a given solid-liquid pair, is defined as the angle between the solid and the tangent drawn to the liquid surface at the point of contact, as measured within the liquid in a vertical section.</p>

		 	<strong>Q6) </strong>Define elevation and depression of a liquid in a capillary tube.

		 	<br><br>

		 	<p id="new"> 

			 	=> The elevation or depression in a capillary tube of radius 'r' is given by the expression,

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsph = (2Scos &Theta;)/&rho;gr

			 	<strong><u>Elevation: </u></strong><p id="new">When the liquid level in the capillary tube is higher than in the outer vessel, 'h', here is the amount of elevation.

		 	<strong><u>Depression: </u></strong><p id="new">When the liquid level in the capillary tube is lower than in the outer vessel then 'h' here is the amount of depression.

		 	<br><br>

		 	For a non wetting liquid(eg. mercury in glass), &Theta; is obtuse and cos &Theta; < 0. So, the rise 'h' is negative. </p>

		 	<strong>Q7) </strong>Define simple harmonic motion. Derive the general solution of simple harmonic motion.

		 	=><br><br>

		 	<strong><u>Simple harmonic motion: </u></strong><p id="new">If a particle moves to and fro in a straight line such that the restoring force is always directed towards a fixed point on its path and is proportional to its distance from the fixed point, the particle is said to perform simple harmonic motion. <br><br>

		 	For small displacements, the restoring force F tend to bring the particle back to its position of rest and is proportional to x. Thus, we write,

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspF = -sx -------(i) <br><br>

		 	where, 's' is the constant of proportionality called the spring constant.

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbspor, &nbsp(m d<sup>2</sup>x)/dt<sup>2</sup> = -sx -------(ii)

		 	<br><br>

		 	where, m = mass of the particle.

		 	<br><br>

		 	Putting w<sup>2</sup> = s/m,

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspd<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -w<sup>2</sup>x

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspd<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> + w<sup>2</sup>x = 0 -------(iii)

		 	<br><br>

		 	This is the eq<sup>n</sup> of motion of Linear harmonic oscillator.

		 	<br><br>

		 	Let the solution of differential eq<sup>n</sup>(iv) be,

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspx = e<sup>nt</sup> <br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspor, &nbsp d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = n<sup>2</sup> e<sup>nt</sup>

		 	<br><br>

		 	dx/dt = ne<sup>nt</sup>

		 	<br><br>

		 	Now, from (iv), we get,

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspn<sup>2</sup>e<sup>nt</sup> + w<sup>2</sup>e<sup>nt</sup> = 0

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspn<sup>2</sup> + w<sup>2</sup> = 0 <br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspn = &#177; jw &nbsp&nbsp where, j = &#8730;-1

		 	<br><br>

		 	Thus, the general sol<sup>n</sup> is:

		 	<br><br>

		 	&nbsp&nbspx = Ce<sup>jwt</sup> + De<sup>-jwt</sup> -------(v)

		 	<br><br>

		 	where C and D are two complex constants

		 	<br><br><br>

		 	Let C = C<sub>1</sub> + jC<sub>2</sub> and D = D<sub>1</sub> + jD<sub>2</sub>

		 	<br><br>

		 	where C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> are real constants.

		 	<br><br>

		 	Using Euler's relationship: e<sup>&#177;j&Theta;</sup> = cos &Theta; &#177; jsin &Theta;, we get,

		 	<br><br>


			 	<p style="font-size: 14px;" id="new">x = (C<sub>1</sub>+C<sub>2</sub>)(cos wt+jsin wt)+(d<sub>1</sub>+jD<sub>2</sub>)(cos wt - jsin wt)</p>

			 	<p style="font-size: 14px;margin-left: 12px;" id="new">={(C<sub>1</sub>+D<sub>1</sub>)cos wt + (D<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>)sin wt} + j{(C<sub>2</sub>+D<sub>2</sub>)cos wt+(C<sub>1</sub>-D<sub>1</sub>)sint wt}</p>

			 	<br>
			 	<p style="font-size: 15px;" id="new">&#8756; x = a cos wt+bsin wt (using real or imaginary part) </p>

			 	<br>

			 <p id="new">

			 	So that, A = &#8730;(a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>) and tan &Phi; = a/b

			 	<br><br>


			 	&#8756; x = Asin(wt + &Phi;) --------(vi)

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbsp &Phi; = &Theta; + &Pi;/2

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbspx = A cos(wt + &Theta;) -----(vii)

			 	<br><br>

			 	Eq<sup>n</sup>s (vi) and (vii) are the general physical solution of eq<sup>n</sup> (iv).

			 	<strong>Q8) </strong>Define superposition of simple harmonic motion. Derive damped and forced vibrations.

			 	<br><br>

			 	=>Two or more simple harmonic motions can be added to get a resultant oscillation which is simple harmonic in nature. This is the superposition of simple harmonic motion.

			 	<br><br>

			 	<strong><u>Damped Vibration: </u></strong> <br><br>

			 	Let 'x' be the instantaneous displacement of a particle of mass 'm' performing a damped motion from its initial position of rest. The following forces acts on the particle.

			 	<br><br>

			 	a) The restoring force which is proportional to the displacement 'x' and is equal to -sx where s is the spring constant. <br><br>

			 	b) The retarding or resisting force caused by friction. This force is proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the particle and is given by -k dx/dt, where, 'k' is the resisting force per unit velocity.

			 	<br><br>

			 	&#8756; The net force acting on the particle is,

			 	<br><br>

			 	m d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -sx - k dx/dt <br><br>

			 	or, d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> + 2b dx/dt + w<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x = 0

			 	<br><br>

			 	where, 2b = k/m and w<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> = s/m

			 	<br><br>

			 	This si the equation for Damped vibration.

			 	<br><br>

			 	<strong><u>Forced Vibration: </u></strong> <br><br>

			 	Let a particle of mass m, capable of executing a damped simple harmonic motion, be subjectes to an external simple harmonic force of constant amplitude and frequency. Suppose, that 'x' is the displacement of the particle from its mean position at time 't'. The forces acting on the particle are:

			 	<br><br>

			 	i. The forces of restitution -sx, 's' being stiffness factor. <br><br>
			 	ii. The retarding or the resisting force -kdx/dt, 'k' being the resisting force per unit velocity. <br><br>

			 	&#8756;  The net force acting on the particle is,

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbspm d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = Fcos wt - sx - kdx/dt

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbspd<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> + 2b dx/dt + w<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x = (F/m)cos wt

			 	<br><br>

			 	&nbsp&nbspwhere, 2b = k/m and w<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> = s/m. 

			 	<br><br> 

			 	The quantity w<sub>0</sub> is the 

			 	undamped natural angular frequency of the particle and b is the decay constant.

			 	<br><br>

			 	This is the eq<sup>n</sup> for forced vibration.

			 	<br>

			 	<strong>Q9) </strong>Define sharpness of a resonance and explain resonance of a vibration.

			 	<br><br>

			 	=> The sharpness of a resonance gives the rapidity with which the average power supplied drops off as 'w' differs from its value at resonance. <br><br>

			 	Resonance is a particular case of forced vibration when the frequency of the driving periodic force equals the natural frequency of the system.

			 	<br><br> <hr> <br><br>


			 	<strong>Q10) </strong>Define plane progressive waves. Write down its basic characteristics.

			 	<br><br>

			 	=> A wave propagating from one point to another in a medium without being subjected to any boundary condition is termed as progressive wave.

			 	<br><br>

			 	<strong><u>Characteristics: </u></strong>

			 	<br><br>

			 	i. The waves are produced by the periodic vibrations of the particle in the medium.
			 	<br><br>
			 	ii. Each particle of the medium oscillates about its mean position with the same amplitude and period. In the simplest case, the vibrations are simple harmonic.
			 	<br><br>
			 	iii. The phase difference between two vibrating particles on the line of propagation is proportional to the distance between the particles.
			 	<br><br>
			 	iv. The medium as a whole does not move along with the wave, only the energy is carried by the advancement of the waveform in the direction of propagation of the wave.
			 	<br><br>
			 	v. The wave velocity in a given medium is a constant determined by the density and the elasticity of the medium.

			 	<br><br><hr><br><br>

			 	<strong>Q11) </strong>State and explain Doppler's effect of sound. <br><br>

			 	=> The pitch of a note, i.e., its frequency as perceived by a listener, appears to change when there is a relative motion between the source of sound and the listener.

			 	<br><br>

			 	The apparent inequality between the emitted and the perceived frequencies is referred to as Doppler effect.

			 	<br><br>

			 	The pitch or the frequency of the whistle of a railway engine or the sound of an aeroplane appears to increase as the source approaches a listener and recedes from him. The closer the listener stands to the line of motion of the source and the higher the speed, the more sudden the change.
