		<strong>Carnot cycle</strong> <br><br>

		<p>During a part of the cycle performed by the working substance in an engine, some heat is absorbed from a hotter reservoir; during another part of a cycle, a smaller amount of heat is rejected to a cooler reservoir. Therefore, the engine is said to operate between these two reservoirs. Since, it is a fact of experience that some heat is always rejected to the cooler reservoir, the efficiency of an actual engine is never 100 percent. If we assume that we have at our disposal two reservoirs at given temperatures, it is important to answer the following questions: <p style="color: #ee82ee;">(1) What is the maximum thermal efficiency that can be achieved by an engine operating between these two reservoirs, in asmuch as 100 percent efficiency is not allowed by the second law? <br><br> (2) What are the characteristics of such an engine? <br><br> (3) Of what effect is the nature of the working substance? </p> </p>


		<p>The importance of these questions was recognized by Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot, a brilliant young French engineer who, in 1824, before the first law of thermodynamics was firmly established, described in a paper entitled <span id="another">"Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu" ("Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire")</span> an ideal engine operating in a particularly simple cycle known today as the <span style="color: red;">Carnot cycle.</span></p>

		<p>In describing and explaining the behaviour of the idealized heat engine, Carnot made use of three terms: <span id="another">feu, chaleur,</span> and <span id="another">calorique</span>. By <span id="another">feu,</span> he meant fire or flame, and, when the word is so translated, no misconceptions arise. Carnot gave, however, no definitions for <span id="another">chaleur</span> and <span id="another">calorique</span>, but in a footnote stated that they had the same meaning. If both of these words are translated as heat, then Carnot's reasoning is contrary to the first law of thermodynamics. There is, however, some evidence that, in spite of the unfortunatee footnote, Carnot did not mean the same thing by <span id="another">chaleur</span> and <span id="another"></span>. Canot used <span id="another">chaleur</span> when referring to the heat in general, but when referring to the motive power of fire that is brought about when heat enters an engine at high temperature and leaves at low temperature, he used the expression <span id="another">chute de calorique</span>, never <span id="another">chute de chaleur</span>. It is the opinion of some scientists that Carnot had in the back of his mind the concept of entropy, for which he reserved the term <span id="another">calorique</span>. This seems incredible, and yet it is a remarkable circumstance that, if the expression <span id="another">chute de calorique</span> is translated as "fall of entropy", many of the objections to Carnot's work raised by Kelvin, Clapeyron, Clausius, and others are no longer valid. </p>
