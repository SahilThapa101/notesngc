		<u><strong>Hologram : </strong></u> <br><br>

			&nbspThe idea of the hologram was first proposed by Dr. D. Gabor in 1948 who named it from Greek word <span id="another">holos</span>, meaning whole. A hologram contains the whole of the information of the wave from the object phase as well as amplitude.

			Unlike a normal two-dimensional image formed on a piece of paper by a glass lens, a hologram provides a true three dimensional record of the object. The hologram itself is two dimensional but using a laser a three dimensional image may be constructed. The hologram is formed by allowing a reference beam to interfere with the light scattered from the object, using a mirror and a photographic plate [Fig. 4.52]. <br><br>

			The image of the object may be reconstructed from the hologram by allowing a laser beam to fall on it. Fig. 4.52(b) shows the process. If you move your head and view the image from different positions you will see that it is truly three dimesional.
