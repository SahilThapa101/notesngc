		"Laser" means <span id="another">Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.</span> It produces an intense beam of coherant light(i.e., the wave motion is in phase for all photons in the beam) the wavelength of which corresponding to one particular energy-level transition for a large number of atoms. <br><br>

		According to quantum theory of radiation, an atom may undergo transition between energy states if it emits or absorbs a photon of the appropriate energy. When an atom in the ground state, for example, absorbs a photon and make a transition to a higher energy state or level, the photon is said to have 'stimulated' the absorption. The atom cannot increase its energy 'spontaneously' i.e., in the absence of a photon. <br><br>

		We might expect that the atom in its higher state would emit a photon of energy <span>&#8462;&#957;</span> spontaneously in returning to its ground state i.e., the probability of emission would be independent of the number of photons present in the environment of the atom. But that is not the case. The probability per unit time that an atom will decay to a lower energy state and emit a photon was found to be the sum of the two terms. One is a spontaneous emission term and the  other is a '<span id="another">stimulated term</span>' which is again proportional to the number of photons of the relevant energy already present in the environment of the atoms. Further, the photon produced by stimulated emission is always in phase with the stimulating photon.

		Consider an atom having two states [Fig. 4.47]. N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> are the number of atoms per unit volume in states 1 and 2 respectively. Let u(v) represent energy density of radiation i.e., u(v)dv represents the energy density in the frequency interval v and v+dv. Now absorbing radiation of frequency v, an atom will jump from the state 1 to state 2.

		The excited atom will now emit photon and will come down from the state 2 to the original state 1. This can happen in two ways <span id="another">viz.,</span>  (i) spontaneous emission and  (ii) stimulated emission. The number of spontaneous emission will be proportional to N<sub>2</sub> and if the proportionality constant is denoted by A, then N<sub>2</sub>A will represent the number of spontaneous emissions per unit volume per unit time. Finally, the number of stimulated emission will be proportion to N<sub>2</sub> and also to the radiation energy density u(v). If the proportionality constant is denoted by B, then N<sub>2</sub>B u(v) will represent the number of stimulated emissions per unit volume per unit time. The quantities A and B are known as Einstein's coefficients. It may proved that <br><br>(8&Pi;&#8462;&#957;<sup>3</sup>B)/C<sup>3</sup> = A.

		<br><br>

		The above equation gives the relation between the Einstein's coefficients.

		&nbsp&nbsp<u><strong><span id="topic">General principle of laser :</span></strong></u>

		<br><br>

		&nbsp&nbspLet us consider the case of an atom with energy level E above the ground state of energy E<sub>0</sub>, for which the probability of spontaneous emission is nearly nil but that of stimulated emission is fairly high. Suppose, that somehow a large number of atoms are injected into this excited state E. As the stimulated emission term is proportional to the number of photons present in the neighbourhood of the excited atoms, these atoms will not decay until there are photons of energy (E - E<sub>0</sub>) present in the system. <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbspIf, now, a few photons of the requisite energy (i.e., E - E<sub>0</sub>) are introduced, stimulated emission will take place immediately and a number of photons of the same kind will be available. This increases the number of photons, which in turn, stimulate the emission of more photons. Thus, a 'chain-reaction' is produced with the result that all the atoms present emit their photons very rapidly. This process is called 'light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation', since the original pulse of photons has been amplified into a much more powerful pulse. The word <span id="another">LASER</span> has been coined by putting the initial words of the name of the above process.

		<br><br>

		&nbsp&nbspThe Laser pulses have the following characteristics : <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp(i) They are <span id="another">monochromatic</span> because all the photons posssess the same energy (E - E<sub>0</sub>) above the ground state and hence the same wavelength <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lambda; = (c.&#957;)/(E - E<sub>0</sub>), <br><br>

		where c = velocity of light and &#957; = Planck's constant. <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp(ii)They are <span id="another">coherant</span> because all the waves are in same phase. 
		<br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp(iii) They are <span id="another">intense</span> because all the waves are coherant. Had the waves been out of phase or non-coherant, the resultant intensity would have been proportional to n X a<sup>2</sup> where a is the amplitude of each wave and n is the number of waves. As the waves are in phase, however, their total amplitude becomes n.a and hence the intensity becomes proportional to n<sup>2</sup>.a<sup>2</sup> i.e., the intensity becomes greater by a factor n than that obtained from non-coherant waves. Since, n is very large, the intensity is increased enormously.

		<br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp(iv) They are <span id="another">rectilinear</span> and <span id="another">almost parallel</span> so much so that a laser beam sent from a tube of 30 cm diameterwill have a divergence less than a kilometer when it arrives at the surface of the moon. <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbsp<u><strong><span id="topic">Principle of Ruby Laser</span></strong></u> <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbspLaser may be of three types : (i) ruby lasers (ii) gas lasers (iii) lasers made of semi-conductors. The means of 'pumping' and of stimulating are different in three cases. We consider here the ruby laser whose principle is as follows: <br><br>

		&nbsp&nbspOrdinarily, in a system of atoms in thermal equilibrium with some kind of electromagnetic radiation, the distribution of energies, according to Boltzmann law is given by : <br><br>

			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> = e<sup>(E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2</sub>)Kt</sup>

			<br><br>

			&nbsp&nbsp where n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub> is the ratio of the numbers of atoms having energies E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>1</sub> at a temperature T, k being Boltzmann constant. Thus higher the energy of a level, the lower is the number of atoms in it (Fig. 4.48). This is called a '<span id="another">normal population</span>' of atoms among the available energy states. It is the reversal of this law in certain circumstances that is referred to as '<span>population inversion</span>'. In a ruby laser population inversion is produced in the following way : <br><br>

			<br><br>


			&nbsp&nbspConsider an atom which has three energy levels E<sub>0</sub> (ground state), E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> (Fig. 4.49). By means of a flash, for example, a large number of atoms is first excited or 'pumped' to an energy state E<sub>2</sub> by photons of energy (E<sub>2</sub>-E<sub>0</sub>) shown by the stage no. 1. The excited atoms undergo spontaneous decay to the lower level E<sub>1</sub> emitting photons of energy (E<sub>2</sub>- E<sub>1</sub>) as shown by the stage no. 2.

			<br><br>

			&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=159E7RoVLw8WBpdjZ67inuhy--yMqrxp1" height="230px;" width="310px;"> <br><br>

			&nbspNow, the energy state E<sub>1</sub> acquires the special property of having a large probability of stimulated emission so that atoms of this energy state are unable to decay spontaneously. The energy state E<sub>1</sub> is thus surrounded with a far greater number of atoms than the ground state E<sub>0</sub>, thus bringing about a population inversion between these two energy states. <br><br>

			&nbspAny stray photon with the requisite energy (E<sub>1</sub> - E<sub>0</sub>) will now produce stimulated emission, followed by chain reaction as described earlier.

			&nbsp<u><strong><span id="topic">Description of Ruby laser : </span></strong></u>

			<br><br>

			Fig. 4.50 shows the form of a ruby laser tube. Ruby is alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) with about 0.05 per cent of the aluminium atoms replaced by chromium. It is only the chromium atoms which take part in the laser action. The tube consists of a hollow cylinder of light-transparent ruby, one face of which is covered by a fully silvered mirror and the other by a partially silvered mirror. To stimulate the atoms, a xenon flash-tube is wound like a cork-screw over the cylinder. When the flash tube operates above a certain critical light intensity, a population inversion is created among the chromium atoms. They are first excited to the energy level E<sub>2</sub> (fig. 4.50) where they stay for a very short while to the extent of about 10<sup>-8</sup> s and drop into the level E<sub>1</sub> which is metastable. This means that a transition to the ground state is very imporable, so that they remain in it long enough fo rmost of them to be triggered and emit stimulated rather than random radiation.

			<br><br>

			&nbspThe function of the mirrors is to reflect the stimulated radiation backwards and forwards from ends of the cylinder and generate more coherant photons from the population all moving in one direction. A narrow intense flash emerges from the partially silvered end, lasting for about a microsecond. Several flashes occur per millisecond when the xenon flash tube triggers as well as pumps. the output wave from a ruby laser has a wavelength &lambda; = 6943 &#8491; with a spread of only 0.02 &#8491;.

			<br><br>&nbspApplications of laser include local melting, cutting and welding. A lens must be used to concentrate the beam on a very small spot in order to perform these operations. The transmission of modulated signals over very long distances can be achieved with a laser beam. Its highly directional property makes it a suitable device for use in rader. Scientists believe that laser will be a valuable tool for space research and investigations.

			&nbsp<u><strong><span id="topic">Gas (Helium-neon) laser : </span></strong></u> Laser action has been made possible in a mixture of inert gases like helium and neon and this has helped the scientists to develop gas laser which has some advantages over solid ruby laser.

			<br><br>

			&nbsp&nbsp<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AR5CInDT7xp36OSezeOCOlkMGwePbtXe" height="230px;" width="310px;">

			<br><br>

			Fig. 4.51 shows the basic features of a gas laser tube. A mixture of gelium and neon gases (sometimes carbon dioxide is also used) is taken inside a long quartz tube. The two ends of the tube are closed by two optically plane mirrors M and M. Discharge in the gas mixture is produced by a powerful radio-frequency generator so that helium atoms are excited to a higher energy level by collison with energised helium atoms and population inversion is created. Stimulated emission then occurs as the neon atoms undergo transition to a lower energy level. A He-Ne laser gives out radiation of wavelength 6328&#8491; in optical region. However 1.15&#181;m and 3.39&#181;m wavelength are also provided by He-Ne laser in near infrared and infra-red respectively.

			<br><br>

			&nbspA gas laser has several advantages over the ruby laser or the so called solid laser; an important advantage being that the light is produced as a continuous beam rather than in ultra-short pulses as in ruby laser. Further in ruby laser, the crystal and other imperfections in solid cause a slight divergence of the beam and slight spread of wavelengths. In gas laser this does not happen.
